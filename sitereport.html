        <h2>Site Development Report</h2>

        <p>
            As part of the CSY1063 Web Development module, I developed a portfolio website to present my projects.For my CSY1063 Web Development module, I built a portfolio website to showcase my work. The challenge was to create a responsive, multi‑page site using only HTML and CSS, while keeping everything in line with modern web standards. Working on it gave me the chance to really practice how a site should be structured and helped me feel more confident with front‑end coding
        </p>

        <p>
            At the start, I sketched out the layout and decided the site would have five main sections: Home, Projects, Contact, Video Demo, and Site Report. To make the whole site feel connected, I reused the same navigation bar, header, footer, and colour scheme across all pages. This consistency made the site look cleaner and also made it easier for visitors to move around.
        </p>

        <p>
           As I built the pages, I experimented with CSS to handle spacing, alignment, and responsiveness. On the Projects page, I set up a grid layout that shows items in one row on desktop screens, switches to two columns on tablets, and stacks into a single column on mobile. I also added a simple hamburger menu using CSS so the navigation works smoothly on smaller devices. These touches helped the site adapt nicely to different screen sizes

        <p>
            Code validation was an important part of this assignment. Each HTML file was
            tested using the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C HTML Validator</a>,
            and all reported issues were corrected until no errors or warnings remained.
            The stylesheet was also checked using the
            <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">W3C CSS Validator</a>,
            which confirmed that the CSS code met official standards. Screenshots of these
            validation results are included below as evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, there were small hurdles along the way — uneven text alignment, spacing issues, and making sure images scaled properly. Regular browser testing and repeated validation checks helped me catch and fix these problems. I learned that even tiny changes in CSS can make a big difference in how a site looks and feels
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, the project gave me hands‑on experience writing clean HTML and CSS and showed me why responsive design matters so much. It also taught me that planning, testing, and validating at each stage leads to a stronger final product. Step by step, solving problems and refining the site gave me a solid base to build on for future web development work.
